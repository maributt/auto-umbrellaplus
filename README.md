<h1 align="center">auto-umbrella+</h1>
<p align="center">a <a href="https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud">dalamud</a> plugin to give every <s>job</s> <i>gearset</i> its own umbrella!

minimal configuration needed out of the box, you can download it and forget it<br>
unless you're against a *slight* bit of automation, in which case you can `/au autoswitch` disable it<br>
from there you can set each of your gearsets' umbrellas either through the fashion accessories menu...<br>
or using `/au [id or "umbrella name"] [job name]` (or `/au` - restores/applies your gearset's saved umbrella) in a gearset/job change macro!<br>
